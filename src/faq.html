                        <p>Anyone! If you’re reading this, you can attend.
                            This includes people who have never been to a hackathon before. 
                            You do not need to be an expert to participate, and the people at the event are super friendly. 
                            We have tons of mentors and helpers to support you, so please do come over!</p>

                        <p>Absolutely not! Admission is free, and so is the food. The event is financed entirely by our awesome sponsors.</p>

                        <p>All-nighters are cool, but if you need some rest, we’ve got you covered. We have a quiet little room where you can take a nap. 
                            However, we do not provide any sleeping equipment, so please bring a sleeping bag or whatever else you need to sleep comfortably.</p>

                        <p>The event is hosted at the ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany.
                        Tram line 2 brings you from the main station to the ZKM. 
                        Get out at the stop “ZKM” or “Arbeitsagentur”, both are only a few minutes away from the hackathon.
