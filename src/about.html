                        We want to motivate as many people as possible to join the hacking community. We want to
                        organize an event where young hackers can work on their own pet projects, while experienced
                        hackers can compete for prizes in ambitious categories.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        We want to unite participants from all kinds of backgrounds. We want designers,
                        organizers and artists to join the community of hackers and makers.
                        We want people to pour all their creativity into their project in an inspiring environment.

                        focused on coding and
                        hacking. We try to bring a bit of Silicon Valley to the German
                        computer-science and start-up community by disrupting the status quo. We do this by
                        organizing hackathons, coding boot camps
                        and other similar events.

                        all kinds of backgrounds come together to discuss one big topic. This year it's the future of transportation, so get pumped!
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        TalKIT takes a look at this topic from many different angles, not just tech. It's a great
                        experience and tons of fun. However, be aware that the entire talKIT conference is in German, while the hackathon is in English.
